                <h5 class="subheadings_content">Introduction</h5>
                <p class="blog-content">The idea that a product has life “stages” is at least as old as the 1930s. In
                  fact, an ad agency employee in 1957 is believed to be the first to theorize the five-stage product
                  life
                  cycle, which included introduction, growth, maturity, saturation and finally, decline. </p>
                <p class="blog-content">Today, Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) is well known as the comprehensive
                  process that covers every stage of a product’s journey—from the initial spark of an idea, through
                  design
                  and production, to its final phase of retirement or reuse. The exact stages may differ from industry
                  to
                  industry, but PLM, broadly, is a process that harmonizes all aspects of product management, including
                  manufacturing and marketing, that help ensure consistency and efficiency across the board. </p>
                <p class="blog-content">In the fashion industry, where trends shift in the blink of an eye, managing the
                  lifecycle of a product effectively can be a mammoth task. PLM systems are crucial for helping brands
                  scale and grow. This blog explores the stages of fashion product lifecycles, how they can be managed
                  effectively, and the digital solutions, such as PIM, PDM, ERP, and PLM, that help fashion brands
                  manage
                  their development processes.</p>

                  <p class="blog-content">Fashion businesses operate within a highly fragmented and complex supply
                    chain,
                    characterized by rapid design cycles, tight deadlines, and changing consumer tastes. The pressure to
                    bring new collections to market quickly, while maintaining quality and staying ahead of competitors,
                    makes PLM solutions indispensable. </p>
                  <p class="blog-content">A PLM System for fashion integrates the work of various teams, including
                    design,
                    development, sourcing, production, and marketing—so that everyone is on the same page, reducing
                    errors,
                    accelerating time-to-market, and ultimately driving profitability. </p>
                  <p class="blog-content">This alignment is particularly crucial in fashion, where even the slightest
                    delay
                    or miscommunication can lead to significant setbacks, from missed trends to unsold inventory. A good
                    PLM
                    centralizes and streamlines workflows, enabling brands to quickly respond to market demands and
                    consumer
                    preferences, ensuring that the right product reaches the right customer at the right time and at the
                    right price. </p>
